# Don't Look Back in Anger
Code accompanying the paper *Don't Look Back in Anger: Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization with Nonstationary Data.*

Authors: *Dominic Keehan, Edward Anderson, Wolfram Wiesemann.*

## Description
......

## Dependencies
You must install a recent version of Julia from http://julialang.org/downloads/. The paper uses Julia 1.9.

A number of Julia packages are required. They can be added by commanding:

`using Pkg' 'Pkg.add("JuMP, ......")`.*

*Note that a proprietary license for Gurobi is also required; see https://www.gurobi.com/solutions/licensing/. The paper uses Gurobi 1XXXX.0

## Reproducing Output from the Paper
You can reproduce Figure~1 by running the script "plot-ambiguity-sets.jl". 
                  Figure~XXXX                       "......jl".
                  Figure~XXXX                       "......jl".
                  Figure~XXXX                       "......jl".*

*Note that Figure~XXXX requires data files generated from a high performance computer through the script ".......jl" with "doit.pbs" and 10000 jobs. The data files are too large to host on GitHub, but should be avaialable as supplementary materials to this paper.
