## Reproducing Output from the Paper
You can reproduce Figure 1 by running the script "plot-ambiguity-sets.jl".

You can reproduce Figure XXXX by running the script ".......jl".*

*Note that Figure XXXX relies on data files generated by the script ".......jl". This is designed to run in a high-performance computing environment using the "doit.pbs" job submission script and 10000 jobs. The data files are too large to host on GitHub, but should be avaialable as supplementary material from https://.......
